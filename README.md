# Server Side Rendering - React

## Stack

### Client:
* HTML
* React
* Sass

### Server:
* Node >= 6
* Express

## Considerations: 
* Usability 
* SEO 
* Performance 
* Scalability

## General comments
> The idea of the project was to maintain the required technological stack, not to use more frameworks than the ones mentioned above. So the use of Redux, Nextjs, presentation frameworks (Bootstrap, etc), among others, were not taken into account.
Pure HTML and Sass were used, implementing Flexbox. On the other hand, server-side rendering was essential to achieve SEO and performance. 

## Remaining tasks
> I could not resolve the product categories. I understand that I'm missing some endpoint to serialize that information. Anyway, I made a Categories component that, given an array of categories, parses them and presents the information in the front-end.
